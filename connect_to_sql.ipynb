    "To connect to the `sakila` database, we'll use the `pyodbc` library. Below is the script we'll use.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define the Connection String\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection string provides all the details needed to connect to the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connection_string = (\n",
    "    \"Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};\"\n",
    "    \"Server=tcp:sakila5j6roe5xjtdmi.database.windows.net,1433;\"\n",

    "    \"TrustServerCertificate=no;\"\n",
    "    \"Connection Timeout=30;\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Driver**: Specifies the ODBC driver.\n",
    "- **Server**: The database server's address.\n",
    "- **Database**: The target database, in this case, `sakila`.\n",
    "- **Uid/Pwd**: Username and password for authentication.\n",
    "- **Encrypt/TrustServerCertificate**: Ensures secure communication.\n",
    "- **Connection Timeout**: Sets the timeout for establishing the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Establishing a Connection and Running a Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python function that demonstrates how to connect to the database, execute a test query, and close the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def connect_to_database():\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Establish the connection\n",
    "        print(\"Connecting to the database...\")\n",
    "        connection = pyodbc.connect(connection_string)\n",
    "        print(\"Connection successful!\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Create a cursor object\n",
    "        cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Execute a test query\n",
    "        cursor.execute(\"SELECT GETDATE();\")\n",
    "        current_time = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n",
    "        print(f\"Database Server Current Time: {current_time}\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Close the connection\n",
    "        cursor.close()\n",
    "        connection.close()\n",
    "        print(\"Connection closed.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    except pyodbc.Error as e:\n",
    "        print(\"Error while connecting to the database:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Function Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`pyodbc.connect()`**:\n",
    "   Establishes a connection to the database using the connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`connection.cursor()`**:\n",
    "   Creates a cursor object to execute SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`cursor.execute(\"SELECT GETDATE();\")`**:\n",
    "   Runs an SQL query to fetch the server's current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`cursor.fetchone()[0]`**:\n",
    "   Fetches the result of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Closing Connections**:\n",
    "   - `cursor.close()`: Closes the cursor to release resources.\n",
    "   - `connection.close()`: Closes the database connection, ensuring security and resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Running the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the function below to test the connection to your database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    connect_to_database()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Practice and Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Try modifying the query in the `connect_to_database` function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT TOP 5 * FROM some_table;\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe the output and understand how `pyodbc` handles different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always secure your connection strings.\n",
    "2. Close the connection after use.\n",
    "3. Use try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this guide, you’ve learned how to connect to an SQL database using `pyodbc`. Happy coding!\n",
    "```\n",
